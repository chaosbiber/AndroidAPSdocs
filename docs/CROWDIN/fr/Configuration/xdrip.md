# xDrip+ settings

If not already set up then download [xDrip+](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip)

For G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end of 2018 (i.e. serial no. starting with 80 or 81) please make sure to use at least the [master dated 2019/05/18](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

If your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G... try [nightly build 2019/07/28 or later](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

## Basic settings for all CGM & FGM systems

* Make sure to set Base URL correctly including **S** at the end of http**s**:// (not http://)
   
   i.e. https://API_SECRET@your-app-name.herokuapp.com/api/v1/
   
   -> Hamburger Menu (top left of homescreen) -> Settings-> Cloud Upload-> Nightscout Sync (REST-API) -> Base URL

* Deactivate `Automatic Calibration` If the checkbox for `Automatic Calibration` is checked, activate `Download data` once, then remove the checkbox for `Automatic Calibration` and deactivate `Download data` again, otherwise the treatments (insulin & carbs) will be added twice to Nightscout.

* Tap `Extra Options`
* Deactivate `Upload treatments` and `Back-fill data`
* Option `Alert on failures` should also be deactivated. Otherwise you will get an alarm every 5 minutes in case wifi/mobile network is too bad or the server is not available.
   
   ![xDrip+ Basic Settings 1](../images/xDrip_Basic1.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Basic Settings 2](../images/xDrip_Basic2.png)

* **InterApp-Settings** (Broadcast) If you are going to use AndroidAPS and the data should be forwarded to i.e. AndroidAPS you have to activate broadcasting in xDrip+ in Inter-App settings.

* In order for the values to be equal, you should activate `Send the displayed glucose value`.
* If you have also activated `Accept treatments` and broadcasting in AndroidAPS, then xDrip+ will receive insulin, carbs and basal rate information from AndroidAPS and can estimate the hypo prediction etc. more accurately.
   
   ![xDrip+ Basic Settings 3](../images/xDrip_Basic3.png)

### Identify receiver

* Some people have discovered problems with local broadcast (AAPS not receiving BG values from xDrip+) when phone is in airplane mode. Go to Settings > Inter-app settings > Identify receiver and enter `info.nightscout.androidaps`.

## xDrip+ & Dexcom G6

### xDrip+ version depending on G6 transmitter serial no.

For G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end of 2018 (i.e. serial no. starting with 80 or 81) please make sure to use at least the [master dated 2019/05/18](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

If your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G... try [nightly build 2019/07/28 or later](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

### Dexcom specific settings

* Open G5/G6 Debug Settings -> Hamburger Menu (top left of homescreen) -> Settings -> G5/G6 Debug Settings ![Open xDrip+ Settings](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SettingsCall.png)

* Enable the following settings
   
   * `Use the OB1 Collector`
   * `Native Algorithm` (important if you want to use SMB)
   * `G6 support`
   * `Allow OB1 unbonding`
   * `Allow OB1 initiate bonding`
* All other options should be disabled
* Adjust battery warning level to 280 (bottom of G5/G6 Debug Settings)
   
   ![xDrip+ G5/G6 Debug Settings](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_DebugSettings.png)

### Preemptive restarts not recommended

**With Dexcom transmitters whos serial no. is starting with 8G preemtive restarts do not work and might kill the sensor completely!**

The automatic extension of Dexcom sensors (`preemtive restarts`) is not recommended as this might lead to “jumps” in BG values on day 9 after restart.

![xDrip+ Jump after Preemptive Restart](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_PreemptiveJump.png)

What’s clear is that using the G6 is perhaps a little more complex than it as first suggests. To use it safely, there are a few points to be aware of:

* If you are using the native data with the calibration code in xDrip+ or Spike, the safest thing to do is not allow preemptive restarts of the sensor.
* If you must use preemptive restarts, then make sure you insert at a time of day where you can observe the change and calibrate if necessary. 
* If you are restarting sensors, either do it without the factory calibration for safest results on days 11 and 12, or ensure you are ready to calibrate and keep an eye on variation.
* Pre-soaking of the G6 with factory calibration is likely to give variation in results. If you do pre-soak, then to get best results, you will probably need to calibrate the sensor.
* If you aren’t being observant about the changes that may be taking place, it may be better to revert to non-factory-calibrated mode and use the system like a G5.

To learn more about the details and reasons for these recommendations read the [complete article](http://www.diabettech.com/artificial-pancreas/diy-looping-and-cgm/) published by Tim Street at [www.diabettech.com](http://www.diabettech.com).

### Connect G6 transmitter for the first time

**For second and following transmitters see [Extend transmitter life](../Configuration/xdrip#extend-transmitter-life) below.**

For G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end of 2018 (i.e. serial no. starting with 80 or 81) please make sure to use at least the [master dated 2019/05/18](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

If your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G... try [nightly build 2019/07/28 or later](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

* Turn original Dexcom receiver off (if used).
* Long press the red xDrip+ blood drop icon on the main screen to enable the `Source Wizard Button`.
* Use the Source Wizard Button which ensures default settings including OB1 & Native Mode 
   * This guides you through the initial set up.
   * you will need your transmitter serial number if this is the first time you've used it.

* Put in serial number of new transmitter (on the transmitter packaging or on the back of the transmitter). Be careful not to confuse 0 (zero) and O (capital letter o).
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter Serial No](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_TransmitterSN.png)

* Insert new sensor (only if replacing)

* Put transmitter into sensor
* Do not start new sensor before the following information is shown in Classic Status Page -> G5/G6 status -> PhoneServiceState:
   
   * Transmitter serial starting with 80 or 81: "Got data hh:mm" (i.e. "Got data 19:04")
   * Transmitter serial starting with 8G or 8H: "Got glucose hh:mm" (i.e. "Got glucose 19:04") or "Got no raw hh:mm" (i.e. "Got now raw 19:04")
   
   ![xDrip PhoneServiceState](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_PhoneServiceState.png)

* Start sensor (only if replacing)
   
   -> Near the bottom of the screen `Warm Up x,x hours left` must be displayed after a few minutes.

-> If your transmitter serial no. does not start with 8G and there is no time specification after a few minutes stop and restart the sensor.

* Restart collector (system status - if not replacing sensor}
* Do not turn original Dexcom receiver (if used) back on before xDrip+ shows first readings.
* Long press the red xDrip+ blood drop icon on the main screen to disable the `Source Wizard Button`.
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 1](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter01.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter02.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 3](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter03.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 4](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter04.png)

### Transmitter battery status

* Battery status can be controlled in system status (Hamburger menu top left on homescreen)
* Swipe left once to see second screen. ![xDrip+ First Transmitter 4](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Battery.png)

* The exact values when the transmitter “dies” due to empty battery are not known. The following information was posted online after the transmitter “died”:
   
   * Posting 1: Transmitter days: 151 / Voltage A: 297 / Voltage B: 260 / Resistance: 2391
   * Posting 2: Transmitter days: 249 / Voltage A: 275 (at time of failure)

### Extend transmitter life

* So far life cannot be extended for transmitters whos serial no. starts with 8G.
* To prevent difficulties starting sensors it is highly recommended to extend transmitter life before day 100 of first usage.
* Running sensor session will be stopped when extending transmitter life. So extend before sensor change or be aware that there will be a new 2 h warm-up phase.
* Switch to the `engineering mode`: 
   * tap on the character on the right of the xDrip+ start screen that represents a syringe
   * then tap on the microphone icon in the lower right corner
   * In the text box that opens type "enable engineering mode" 
   * click "Done"
   * If Google Speak engine is enabled, you can also speak the voice command: "enable engineering mode". 
* Go to the G5 debug settings and check `OB1 collector`.
* Use the voice command: “hard reset transmitter”
* The voice command will be executed with the next data receipt of the transmitter
* Look at the system status (Hamburger menu -> system status) and see what happens
* If you see a message "Phone Service State: Hard Reset maybe failed" on second system status screen just start the sensor and this message should go away.
   
   ![xDrip+ Hard Reset maybe failed](../images/xDrip_HardResetMaybeFailed.png)

* Transmitter days will be set to 0 after successful extension and start of sensor.

### Replace transmitter

For G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end of 2018 (i.e. serial no. starting with 80 or 81) please make sure to use at least the [master dated 2019/05/18](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

If your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G... try [nightly build 2019/07/28 or later](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

* Turn original Dexcom receiver off (if used).
* Stop sensor (only if replacing sensor)
   
   Ensure it really is stopped:
   
   On the second "G5/G6 Status" screen look at `Queue Items` about half way down - It may say something like `(1) Stop Sensor`
   
   Wait until this goes - usually within a few minutes.
   
   -> To remove transmitter without stopping sensor see this video <https://youtu.be/AAhBVsc6NZo>.
   
   ![xDrip+ Stop Dexcom Sensor 1](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Stop Dexcom Sensor 2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor2.png)

* Forget device (in system status)
   
   ![xDrip+ Forget Device](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_ForgetDevice.png)

* Forget device in smartphone’s BT settings (Will be shown as Dexcom?? whereas ?? are the last two digits of the transmitter serial no.)

* Remove transmitter (and sensor if replacing sensor)
* Long press the red xDrip+ blood drop icon on the main screen to enable the `Source Wizard Button`.
* Use the Source Wizard Button which ensures default settings including OB1 & Native Mode 
   * This guides you through the initial set up.
   * You will need your transmitter serial number if this is the first time you've used it.
* Put in serial number of new transmitter. Be careful not to confuse 0 (zero) and O (capital letter o).
* Insert new sensor (only if replacing).
* Put transmitter into sensor - Do not start sensor immediately!
* Do not start new sensor before the following information is shown in Classic Status Page -> G5/G6 status -> PhoneServiceState:
   
   * Transmitter serial starting with 80 or 81: "Got data hh:mm" (i.e. "Got data 19:04")
   * Transmitter serial starting with 8G or 8H: "Got glucose hh:mm" (i.e. "Got glucose 19:04") or "Got no raw hh:mm" (i.e. "Got now raw 19:04")
   
   ![xDrip PhoneServiceState](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_PhoneServiceState.png)

* Restart collector (system status - if not replacing sensor}

* Do not turn original Dexcom receiver (if used) back on before xDrip+ shows first readings.
* Long press the red xDrip+ blood drop icon on the main screen to disable the `Source Wizard Button`.
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 1](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter01.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter02.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 3](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter03.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 4](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter04.png)

### New Sensor

* Turn original Dexcom receiver off (if used).
* Stop sensor if necessary
   
   Ensure it really is stopped:
   
   On the second "G5/G6 Status" screen look at `Queue Items` about half way down - It may say something like `(1) Stop Sensor`
   
   Wait until this goes - usually within a few minutes.
   
   ![xDrip+ Stop Dexcom Sensor 1](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Stop Dexcom Sensor 2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor2.png)

* Clean contacts (transmitter backside) with alcohol and let air-dry.

* In case you use this function disable `Restart Sensor` and `Preemptive restarts` (Hamburger menu -> Settings -> G5/G6 Debug Settings). If you miss this step and have these functions enabled the new sensor will not start properly.
   
   ![xDrip+ Preemptive Restart](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Restart.png)

* Start Sensor
   
   **It is recommended to wait approx. 15 minutes between stopping and starting the new sensor (until `Sensor Status: Stopped` is shown on second system status screen).**

* Set time inserted
   
   * To use G6 Native mode you must wait for the 2 hour warm up (i.e insertion time is now).
   * If you are using the xDrip+ algorithm then you can set a time more than 2 hours ago to avoid warm up. Readings may be very erratic. Therefore this is not recommended.
* Enter Sensor code (on the peel-off foil of the sensor) 
   * Keep code for further reference (i.e. new start after transmitter had to be removed)
   * Code can also be found in [xDrip+ logs](../Configuration/xdrip#retrieve-sensor-code): Click 3-dots-menu on xDrip+ homescreen and choose `View Event Logs`.
* No calibration is needed if you use G6 in "native mode". xDrip+ will show readings automatically after 2 hour warm-up.
* Do not turn original Dexcom Receiver (if used) back on before xDrip+ shows first readings.
   
   ![xDrip+ Start Dexcom Sensor 1](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SensorStart01.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Start Dexcom Sensor 2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SensorStart02.png)

### Retrieve sensor code

* In master dated 2019/05/18 and the latest nightly builds the sensor code is shown in system status (Hamburger menu top left on homescreen).
* Swipe left once to see second screen.
   
   ![xDrip+ Retrieve Dexcom Sensor Code2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SensorCode2.png)

* Dexcom sensor code can also be found in xDrip+ logs.

* Tap 3 dot menu (top right side on homescreen)
* Select `View Event Logs` and search for "code"
   
   ![xDrip+ Retrieve Dexcom Sensor Code](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SensorCode.png)

## Troubleshooting Dexcom G5/G6 and xDrip+

### Problem connecting transmitter

* Transmitter must be shown in your smartphone's bluetooth settings.
* Transmitter will be shown as Dexcom?? whereas ?? represent the last two digits of your transmitter serial no. (i.e. DexcomHY).
* Open system status in xDrip+ (hamburger menue on top left side of home screen).
* Check if your transmitter is shown on first status page ('classic status page').
* If not: Delete device from your smartphone's bluetooth settings and restart collector.
* Wait about 5 min. until Dexcom transmitter reconnects automatically.

### Problem when starting new sensor

Please note that the following method might likely not work if your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G...

* Native sensor is marked as "FAILED: Sensor Failed Start"
* Arrêter le capteur
* Restart your phone
* Start sensor with code 0000 (four times zero)
* Wait 15 minutes
* Arrêter le capteur
* Start sensor with "real" code (printed on the adhesive protector)

Check in xDrip+ logs if xDrip+ starts counting "Duration: 1 minute" (and so on). Only in the xdrip+ logs you can detect at an early stage whether xdrip+ has stopped a sensor. Latest status is not always shown correctly on bottom of startscreen.

## xDrip+ & Freestyle Libre

### Libre specific settings

* Open Bluetooth Settings -> Hamburger Menu (top left of homescreen) -> Settings -> scroll down -> Less common settings -> Bluetooth Settings
   
   ![xDrip+ Libre Bluetooth Settings 1](../images/xDrip_Libre_BTSettings1.png)

* Enable the following settings
   
   * `Turn Bluetooth on` 
   * `Use scanning`
   * `Always discover services`

* All other options should be disabled
